      <h2>Learnstream</h2>
      <p>I started Learnstream to supercharge my studying in college. Since then, its experiments with learning from video and spaced repetition have helped make a professor into a YouTube celebrity, gotten the attention of Bill Gates, and helped students transition to Harvey Mudd's brutal physics program.</p>

      <h2>Research wiki</h2>
      <p>My research wiki tracked my first year in the Carnegie Mellon PhD program: highlights and summaries from papers I was reading and notes on my own research. The wiki uses <a href="http://reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:start">researchr</a>, but I added several extentions including a frontpage that visualizes my changes over the week.</p>
      <p>If you need a fix of academic papers on learning science and human-computer interaction, head over to <a href="http://wiki.learnstream.org/wiki/">Ryan's Research Wiki</a>.</p>

      <p>Shuff is an experiment in <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/10/todont.html" target="_blank">killing the to-do list</a> via randomness and personal analytics. The web application provides a dashboard representing what you've done that day. If you see something you want to change, do it! If you aren't sure what to work on, Shuff can give you something random to do for a fixed amount of time.</p>
